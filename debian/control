Description: additional features for the Test::Unit testing framework
 Shoulda makes it easy to write elegant, understandable, and maintainable
 tests. Shoulda consists of test macros, assertions, and helpers added on to
 the Test::Unit framework. It's fully compatible with your existing tests, and
 requires no retooling to use.
 .
 Shoulda adds lots of features for testing Rails applications, but can also be
 used for plain Ruby ones.
